# Curl Up and Dye

## A family friendly hairdressers and barbers for all your hair clipping needs!

### About this project

This project is a collaboration between Kieran, Jesse, Charles and Kerry as a warm-up exercise for the upcoming Hackathon event.

Together, we decided on:
- The business (hairdressers/barbers)
- The name of the business (Curl Up and Dye)
- The colour scheme (courtesy of Jesse the Legend)

We each divided ourselves between separate tickets, working on one at a time to produce a glorious website!

### Tools Used

For this project, we implemented Bootstrap styles for components and layout, as well as Bootstrap scripts for a responsive, collapsible navbar.

We used custom CSS to apply custom styles such as colour schemes to be shared across all pages.

## Features

### Navigation Bar

The navigation bar is featured on all three pages and contains links to access the rest of the site.  It is fully responsive and collapses into a hamburger menu on smaller screens.
